            <h2>Who I Am</h2>
            <p>
                I'm an aspiring IT professional currently working towards my Associates in Applied Science Information Technology Degree. 
                I have a strong passion for computer <strong>networking</strong>, <strong>cybersecurity</strong>, and <strong>system administration</strong>. My goal is to continuously learn, 
                develop my technical skills, and apply my knowledge in real-world environments.
            </p>
            
            <h2>My Journey</h2>
            <p>
                I served over five years in the United States Army as an Intelligence Analyst, working closely with IT professionals. 
                This experience sparked my interest in Information Technology. After completing my service, I pursued a degree in IT and quickly realized my passion for the field.
                My journey began with experimenting on home networks and setting up my first personal server. Over time, I’ve gained hands-on experience in networking, Linux administration, and entry-level cybersecurity. Through various projects, I’ve developed a problem-solving mindset and a strong interest in securing IT infrastructures.
